# Predictive-Machine-Learning-Model-for-Employee-Layoff-Risk-Analysis
This project was developed during the first semester of the Master’s program as part of the "Introduction to Machine Learning" course. The core objective was to design a predictive machine learning model that can estimate the likelihood of an employee facing a layoff, using historical HR data.

In the wake of massive layoffs in the tech industry post-COVID-19, this project addresses a socially relevant challenge: understanding and mitigating job insecurity through data-driven insights. Using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset from Kaggle, we analyzed multiple features such as age, job role, income, work experience, overtime, and more, to determine patterns and predictors of attrition.

We built and compared several classification models — including Logistic Regression, LDA, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest, Boosting, and SVM, and optimized them for reducing false negatives, prioritizing accurate identification of at-risk employees.

Our findings showed that Bagging and Boosting were particularly effective in improving both accuracy and sensitivity, even under class imbalance. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model tuning, and ethical handling of employee data were emphasized throughout the project.
